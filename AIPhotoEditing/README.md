# Project Introduction
In this class we have seen how Generative models can be used in Computer Vision. We have also seen how to use the Segment Anything Model to select subjects in images by providing points and other inputs.

Let's put some of this knowledge to good use by building something interesting, and fun!

## Project Instructions
When you start the workspace you will land in a Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions contained there step by step, being on the lookout for sections marked by YOUR CODE HERE.

The gradio app that allows for the interactive experience showcased above is already built for you, you will be able to start it from within the notebook. Then, by clicking on a link, you will be taken to a new tab with the gradio UI available for use.

After completing the code, spend some time playing around in the app. Try to modify the parameters like the Classifier-Free Guidance Scale or the random seed - which you now understand - and see which results you get.

## App instructions
Once you have completed the exercise, the notebook will generate an app to use the functions you wrote in an interactive way.
